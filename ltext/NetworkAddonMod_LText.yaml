Pont Alexandre III is an arch bridge that spans the Seine, connecting the Champs-Élysées quarter and the Invalides and Eiffel Tower quarter, widely regarded as the most ornate, extravagant bridge in Paris. The bridge, with its exuberant Art Nouveau lamps, cherubs, nymphs and winged horses at either end, was built between 1896 and 1900. It is named after Tsar Alexander III, who had concluded the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1892. His son Nicholas II laid the foundation stone in October 1896. The style of the bridge reflects that of the Grand Palais, to which it leads on the right bank.

For building RealHighway FLEX Neighbor Connectors (FLEX-NCs)
Button contains items to build Neighbor Connections for RHW Networks
Use the Home/End key to rotate the FLEX Piece & use TAB/Shift-TAB (Ctrl-TAB/Ctrl-Shift-TAB on macOS) to cycle through the different types of RHW Neighbor Connector items
When the cursor changes from red to green, click to place.
NOTE: ALL REALHIGHWAY NEIGHBOR CONNECTIONS (EXCEPT RHW-2) ARE REQUIRED TO USE NEIGHBOR CONNECTOR PIECES TO ENSURE PROPERLY FUNCTIONING NEIGHBOR CONNECTIONS--OTHERWISE ONLY FREIGHT TRUCKS WILL USE THE RHW
